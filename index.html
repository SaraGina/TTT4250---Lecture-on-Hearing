																		So, as the video mentioned, the cochlea discriminates the frequency in an excellent manner: different regions of the basilar membrane are excited by different frequencies.

																	<aside class="notes">
																		Now that we have discussed the functioning of our auditory system, let's see how do we actually experience sound.
																		<br>
																		1- DESCRIBE FIGURE: <br><br>
																		The figure shows an averaged hearing treshold, the LOWEST SPL (LEVELS) for DETECTING TONAL SOUNDS of different frequencies when those sounds are approximately 500 milliseconds (ms) in duration.

																		<ul>
																			<li> <b>Units</b>: The thresholds are expressed in terms of decibels of SPL, where zero (0) dB SPL means that the sound pressure level is 20 micropascals (i.e., the referent sound pressure (pref) is 20 micropascals).</li>


																		</ul>
																		2- OBSERVATIONS: <br><br>
																		<ul>
																			<li> What it is interesting to OBSERVE is that our EAR RESPONDS differently for EACH FREQUENCY, which means that the we need actually DIFFERENT SPLs to BE ABLE to hear DIFFERENT freq.</li>
																			<li><b>Different levels for different freq. </b>: more energy needed at low frequencies for us to hear them </li>
																			<li> Finally, we can SEE that the <b>MAXIMUM SENSITIVITY</b> region for human hearing is around <b>3-4 kHz</b>.
																			<br>
																			<!-- TEACHING Does anyone know why? -->
																			<br>
																			The <b>REASON</b> is because our <b>EAR CANAL has a RESONANCE</b> around this region and so, it <b>NATURALLY HELPS to HEAR</b> the frequencies between 3-4 kHz.
																		</li>
																			<br>
																			Ex: to hear at one at 250 Hz, we need at least 25 dB SPL; but we just need 10 dB SPLA to hear a tone at 8 kHz.
																			<br>

																			<li><b>dB HL</b>: Hearing level (so someone with 40 dB of Hearing LOSS at 500 Hz, the THRESHOLD for detecting 500Hz would be 50 dB SPL)
																			<li><b>Freq. range TESTED</b>: 250-8000 Hz which corresponds to the SPECTRUM of SPEECH sound
																		</ul>

																		This figure is an AVERAGE curve for "NORMAL HEARING" population.

																	<h6 class="title">Equal Loudness Curves</h6>


																	<img src="examples/assets/Equal_Loudness_contour_curves.png" alt="Websocket" width="100%" style="float: center">


																	<aside class="notes">

																		Another plot which is very commonly used is what we call the Equal Loudness Curves. you may have probably hear about those.
																		<ul>
																			<li> On the ABCISSES we have Frequencies</li>
																			<li> on the y-axis, we have the SPL relative to the reference pressure 20 micropascals (dB SPL)</li>
																		</ul>

																		These curves PRETEND to show all sounds with different frequencies that are PERCEIVED EQUALLY LOUD as a sound of x dB SPL at 1000 Hz.
																		<br>
																		So for instance, if a pure tone is played at <b>1000 Hz at 50 dB</b>, to PERCEIVE the SAME LOUDNESS at a frequency <b>250 Hz</b>, we would need to play the 250 Hz tone at <b>60 dB</b> instead of 50 dB.
																		<br>
																		<ul>
																			<li> The 1000 Hz is chosen as the <b>REFERENCE FREQUENCY</b>, </li>
																			<li> and the <b>UNIT of LOUDNESS</b> for PURE TONES is called PHON and corresponds <b>PERCEPTUALLY</b> to the LEVEL played at 1 kHz.</li>
																		</ul>

																		So, in the case of the <b>60 dB at 250Hz</b> to be perceived as loud as the 50 dB at 1000 Hz, we would say that:
																		<br> <b>"the sound at 60 db SPL at 250Hz has a LOUDNESS of 50 PHONS"</b>.
																		<br>
																		<b>- LOW freq.: </b> We can also OBSERVE that
																		<ul>
																			<li> the ear is LESS SENSITIVE to LOW FREQUENCIES (so we need more SPL to hear low freq.), </li>
																			<li> and this DISCRIMINATION AGAINS LOWS becomes STEEPER for SOFTER sounds. </li>
																		</ul>
																		Ex:
																		<ul>
																			<li> to perceive <b>90 phons</b> at 250 hz, we would need to play 250 Hz at a SPL of <b>93 dB</b> (just 3 dB HIGHER than 90 SPL at 1Khz)</li>
																			<li> to perceive <b>60 phons</b> at 250 hz, we would need to play 250 Hz at a SPL <b>66 dB</b> (6 dB HIGHER)
																			<li> to perceive <b>20 phons</b> at 250 hz, we would need to play 250 Hz at a SPL <b>36 dB</b> (16 dB HIGHER)
																		</ul>


																		<b>Sound discrimination</b>: Over 500 - 4000 Hz and 35 - 80 dB SPL (where humnas are MOST SENSITIVE), listeners are able to DISCRIMINATE:
																		<ul>
																			<li> About <b>1 dB</b> in sound level (50 db and 51 dB)</li>
																			<li> and about a <b>half of a percent</b> change in tonal frequency (2000 Hz and 2010 Hz).</li>
																		</ul>

																		Before GOING to the next section, just note that in this plot, we can also see the <b>HEARING THRESHOLD</b> we have seen on the slide before which corresponds to this <b>lower cruve</b> CORRESPONDING to <b>0 PHONS</b>.

																	<h4 class="title"><em>Classical Pure-Tone Audiometry</em></h4>
																	<h6 class="title">A bit of history</h6>
																	The field of psychophysics -study the relation between <span style="color:#3a84b8;">stimuli and perception</span>- was pioneered by Gustav Fechner in the 1860s:
																	<br>
																	<ul>
																		<li><span style="color:#3a84b8;">the method of limits</span> </li>
																		<li><span style="color:#3a84b8;">the method of adjustment</span> </li>
																		<li><span style="color:#3a84b8;">the method of constant stimuli</span></li>
																	</ul>
																	<br><br>
																	In the 1920s, a graduate student at the University of Iowa, C.C.Bunch, applied <span style="color:#3a84b8;">Fechner’s Method of Limits to hearing</span>.



																	<aside class="notes">
																		<b>Psychophysics:</b> the branch of psychology that deals with the relations between physical stimuli and mental phenomena.
																		Fechner (Germany) introduced various methods for quantitatively measuring the relationship between stimuli and perception:
																		<br>
																		he asked what is the MINIMAL STIMULS STRENGTH, or “threshold,” below which there is NO AWARENESS of the stimulus.
																		<br>
																		<ul>
																			<li><b>the method of limits:</b> the stimulus is presented in either ASCENDING or DESCENDING order to determine the smallest amount detectable.
																				This sequence of descending and ascending runs is REPEATED 3 or more times.
																				Threshold is defined as the <b>MIDPOINT</b> between the average of descending runs and the average of ascending runs. </li>
																			<li><b>the method of adjustment:</b> the OBSERVER continuously ADJUSTS the stimulus until they can or cannot perceive it.
																				Successive trials are <b>AVERAGED</b> to define the threshold response.
																				<br>This differs from the method of limits, because the individual is NOT giving a YES or NO response on each trial.
																				Instead, they are responsible for adjusting the stimulus themselves. </li>
																			<li><b>and the method of constant stimuli:</b> it presents, in a RANDOM order, the stimuli known to be close to the threshold. The threshold is the stimulus value that was detected 50% of the time.
																				<br> Drawbacks: it needs for many trials and it is needed to know where the threshold might be to present the stiumulus around it.
																			</li>
																		</ul>
																		These methods were not suggested for HEARING but rather for any other kind of PHYSICAL STIMULI (Vision, weight perception, etc), so in a way, they were GENERAL methods.
																		<br>
																		For sound perception, in the 1920s a graduate student from the Univ. of Iowa, C.C.Bunch, who studied carefully all the work by Fechner, started publishing his adapted technique which was the method of LIMITS applied to hearing.

																	The Hughson-Westlake method known as the <span style="color:#3a84b8;">“ascending method.” </span>

																	<aside class="notes">

																		During the 1930s, clinicians were following Bunch's technique and were observing different effects:
																		<ul>
																			<li>better to present <b>SHORT tone-bursts</b> against a background of silence rather than </b>LONG continuous tones</b> with only short breaks of silence as the level was changed (specially for HIGH FREQ:)
																				<br>
																				Partly, this concern arose because many noted that subjects adapted to the loudness of high-frequency tones (especially 4000 and 8000 Hz) quickly if the tone was presented for any length of time, particularly if there was
																				hearing loss at these high frequencies.)</li>

																			<li>when using 5-dB steps, there was little difference between the threshold levels revealed by descending versus ascending runs. </li>
																			<li>the threshold level defined by the ascending run seemed more <b>STABLE.</b></li>

																		</ul>

																		In 1944 a paper of major historical significance by Walter Hughson and Harold Westlake was published taking into account the experiences and observations from the clinicians.
																		<br>
																		The figure shows the contrast between Bunch’s <b>ORIGINAL</b> technique with the <b>SUBSEQUENT</b> Hughson-Westlake technique.
																		In Bunch’s method, the test tone was on almost continuously, being interrupted only when the intensity level was changed.
																		By contrast, in the Hughson-Westlake method, short tone bursts are separated by longer periods of silence as the intensity level is changed.
																		Note also that Bunch approached threshold from both directions while Hughson-Westlake relies heavily only on an ascending series.
																		<br>
																		Thus, the Hughson-Westlake recommendations became known as the “ascending method.” The threshold was usually defined as the lowest level at which there had been a response at 2 out of 3 ascending runs.

																	<aside class="notes">
																		The interpretation of the Error Funtion is that for a random variable Y that is NORMALLY distributed with MEAN 0 and VARIANCE 1/2, erf x is the PROBABILITY that Y falls in the range [−x, x].
																		<br>
																		What do we need that function for? <br>
																		A person tested, would not always clearly respond "yes" or "no" to the level exposed. If the person had a cold, if he/she had a stressful day, if she/he listened to high level music before, etc are some
																		situations that might affect the determination. This means that the RESPONSE is a <b>STOCHASTIC PROCESS</b>  and thus, some RANGE of levels around the TRUE hearing TRESHOLD of that person is related to some probability of the person giving a
																		positive or negative answer. This is why we use a so called Psychometric function to illustrate and model that stochastic effect.
																		<br><br>
																		The physchometric function showed in this figure is the error function with a width or standard deviation of 1.4 over a range of $\pm$6 dB.
																		<br><br>
																		The expected Hearing Threshold would be the 0 dB (this is when there is a 50% probability that the tested person gives a positive respons). Whenever a sound is played at any level higher than this reference 0dB, the probability is higher
																		than 50% (note that this means, for instance, that is there is a sound level played at +2dB, there is a 93% probability that the person HEARS the sound but still a 7% of cases where the same person will respond that she/he does not hear
																		it).

																	<aside class="notes">
																		Here is a Matlab Simulation for an audiometry. Starting at a level where the tested person can not hear (usually, the audiologist will start by playing a clearly audible level so that the person gets a sense of which sound is she/he
																		expected to hear to, and then get that level low so that it might the hearing treshold potentially from a non-audible level), in this simulation the next level will be + 4dB higher when the level has not been heard, and -2 dB lower when the
																		levels has been heard.
																		<br>
																		The threshold for that tested person is determined by the lowest level that she/he has detected at least 2 times out of 3. In this case, 10 stimuli have been required to obtained the Hearing threshold of 2dB.
																		<br>
																		What happens if one starts from another level? Let's say -15dB? Note that the expected Hearing Threshold (0 dB) will not be possible to reach due to the +4dB and -2 dB. Also, more presentations will be needed to obtain the hearing threshold
																		(note that this should be done for each frequency one would like to test and for the 2 ears separately!). It is obvious that setting up the range and the resolution (how many dB up / how many down) is finally a compromise between accuracy

																		The NEWT is an automated method (the audiometry is a manual method) which was developed by SINTEF and NTNU in 2014. It is also a pure-tone presentation but it will use 2 instances of it of duration 150 ms, with raised cosine fade in and out
																		of 10 ms each, and with a 150 ms time gaps in between. <br><br>
																		The reason for that is that they found out that a simple pur-tone instance has an EFFECT on the tested person (it might get BORED, ASLEEP and thus not answer properly to the test), and
																		with that type of stimulus, the tested person seems to give more stable responses.
																		<br><br>
																		The NEWT presents the different levels in a RANDOM order, always approaching to the expected Hearing Treshold using a priorly determined Psychometric function.
